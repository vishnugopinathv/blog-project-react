        "description": "Nobody gave them a chance but Gujarat Titans, bucking all pre-tournament predictions, surprised everyone by lifting the Indian Premier League title in a dream maiden season after a seven-wicket victory over Rajasthan Royals in the final here on Sunday. Gujarat's highly-rated bowling attack, led by skipper Hardik Pandya (3/17) himself, limited a formidable Rajasthan Royals batting unit to 130 for nine after losing the toss. Shubman Gill and David Miller remained unbeaten on 45 and 32, respectively, to complete an emphatic win for their team.It should have been a comfortable chase but Rajasthan bowled their hearts out to make it an interesting final. As they showed all season, Gujarat remained calm in tough situations to finish the chase in 18.1 overs.",

Going into the match, Chahal was in second position despite having taken the same number of wickets (26) as RCB's Wanindu Hasaranga.

The Gray Man, directed by the Russo Brothers, boasts a stacked cast - Ryan Gosling plays Court Gentry, codenamed Sierra Six, a black ops agent who goes on the run after discovering incriminating secrets about his agency; his nemesis is Lloyd Hansen, played by Chris Evans, an unhinged fellow mercenary who is tasked with bringing 'the infamous Sierra Six' down. Most of the screen time is devoted to Ryan and Chris, not surprisingly, but several other famous faces appear as well - not least is Dhanush, an assassin who goes after Sierra Six and his allies after Lloyd puts out a hit on him. Dhanush's fight scene is all too brief but he gets in a kick like he means business and there's a shot of him full frame beckoning at his opponent.",

With the hot summer weather can come new different hair-related issues. In this article, we discuss some easy-to-follow haircare tips that will protect and nourish our hair from the effects of the hot summer weather.The best way to protect your hair from the sun's UV rays is to place a physical barrier. Hair's direct and prolonged exposure to the sun can cause dehydration, breakage, and even premature greying of the hair.Wearing tight hair ties and tight hairdos can cause the hair to break and shed. However, tying your hair into a loose braid or bun might help protect it from sun exposure. Hence, we encourage you to try some eat-to-do braid and bun hairstyles to protect your hair this summer.Constant heat and sweating in summer can make you want to wash your hair multiple times a week. However, that is very bad for the scalp and hair. Constant hair washes can wash off the scalp's natural oils that keep the hair and scalp protected from the sun and other external radicals. Loss of sebum and other natural oils can also cause your hair to break.Be it hair drying your hair to fasten the hair drying process or wanting to heat style the hair, we advise you to reduce your usage of heating equipments. Straightening and other heating practices can cause irreversible damage to the hair especially when it has been under the sun for long periods. ",

This means avoiding food, produce, products and by-products from animals thus ensuring that one does not contribute to cruelty towards them. It means not indulging in eating meat, not buying a silk saree, or woolen clothesAs a conscious consumer, it is really a beneficial way of life because by going vegan, one would distance themselves completely from hazardous antibiotics, hormones, and adulteration which is common culture to ensure greater shelf life for most animal products. As exports increase and the world becomes smaller and smaller, more preservatives and chemical compositions are at play to ensure your food survives the journey. Veganism is also a choice of non-violence against bees, cattle, fowl, reptiles, and the oceanic universe who have been prey to man's unlimited hunger for more.Currently though, in the name of veganism, the supermarket shelves are exploding, and It is estimated that the global vegan food market will reach $ 31.4 billion by 2026.This now means that while the intent, when we started, was noble, food companies are resorting to the same practice that today has made animal husbandry the number one cause of global climate changes with almost irreversible effects.Vegan foods available so freely are just horrible fillers in place of the nutritious and guilt-free bounty we were promised.",

The thyroid produces hormones that keep the body running smoothly. The body uses energy too quickly when the thyroid produces too much hormone. This is referred to as hyperthyroidism. Using energy too quickly might cause the heart to beat faster, lead to weight loss without even trying, or even make you feel nervous. On the other hand, your thyroid can produce too little hormone as well. That condition is referred to as hypothyroidism. When there is too little thyroid hormone in the body, you can feel weary, gain weight, and even become unable to tolerate cold temperatures.A diet can have a significant impact on the symptoms of both types of thyroid disorders. Here are a few foods or kinds of foods that a person with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism needs to avoid.Soy-Plant-based phytoestrogen is abundant in soy products. This interferes with the thyroid hormone's capacity to function. It can aggravate hypothyroidism.Fatty foods-Fats obstruct the absorption of thyroid hormone and thyroid hormone replacement medications in the body. It also decreases thyroid hormone production, aggravating hypothyroidism.Sugar-The calories in sugar contain no nutrition but can cause the body's metabolism to slow down. It also causes weight gain, which exacerbates hypothyroidism.",

        "description": "Actor Ayushmann Khurrana, who is lauded time and again for breaking societal stereotypes and taboos with his films seems to have witnessed a setback with his latest outing. The actor collaborated with his Article 15 director Anubhav Sinha for the latest release, the spy thriller Anek. However, going by the early estimate numbers at the box office, it seems that the actor failed to leave an impressionistic mark with his new release.The socio-political film, which opened to dull response, failed to attract moviegoers. Despite the gripping storyline where Ayushmann plays the titular role of an undercover agent Joshua aka Aman, the movie seemed to not resonate well with the moviegoers, and hence, the Box Office numbers were highly disappointing.The film raked in Rs 1.75 crore on the opening day, which is the lowest as compared to Khurrana's previous releases, but did not pick up the pace during the first weekends. According to the report of sancilk.com, the early estimated collection shows that the film earned only Rs 1.90 crore on Sunday. Now, the total collection stands at Rs 6 crores. The expectations of the people to see the growth of the film at the box office during the weekend failed tremendously. On Saturday, the film collected Rs 2.11 crore. The subject of the film that held relevance in today's contemporary Indian politics,  seemed to not resonate with the moviegoers. The film, which highlights the insurgency in North-East India and the need for a unified India, has been bankrolled by Bhushan Kumar’s T-Series and Anubhav Sinha's Benaras Mediaworks. On the other hand, another major setback for the makers could be the rising popularity of actor Kartik Aaryan's latest release Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2. The film which is the sequel to actor Akshay Kumar's horror-comedy has entered finally made a century after it entered the Rs 100 crore club. The spooky comedy directed by Aneez Bazme is registering impressive numbers and has dethroned Kangana Ranaut starrer Dhaakad and Anek on its successful 10th day of theatrical run. Apart from Kartik, the film also stars Kiara Advani, Tabu, Sanjay Mishra, Rajpal Yadav, Amar Upadhyay, and others taking on some pivotal roles.  ",

The singer-turned-Congress leader was shot dead by unidentified gunmen in Punjab's Mansa district. While many from the Punjabi music and film industry mourned the demise, actor Kangana Ranaut questioned the state's Law & Order. Soon after the attack on late singer Sidhu Moosewala, the AAP-led government in Punjab has been facing the brunt as they downgraded the security cover of the late Congress leader. On May 26, as part of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s security pruning exercise, the singer's security cover was halved from four to two. Actor Kangana grieved the late singer's death by taking to her Instagram stories in Hindi which is roughly translated to 'Punjab's well-known face Siddhu Moosewala was brutally shot dead in Punjab. This is shocking news for the entire country.' Following this, the Manikarnika star who is known to voice her opinion boldly decried the state's Law and Order situation. 'This incident just clearly defines the Law and Order situation in Punjab,' the actor concluded.Apart from Kangana, several other stars also expressed their shock over the sudden death. Punjabi singer Diljit Dosanjh shared a picture of the late singer on Instagram and mourned the demise. His caption in Punjabi fairly translated into Hindi read, 'Oh Waheguru, heartbreaking news...The boy was very talented. I never had the opportunity to meet him in person, but his talent always spoke about him no doubt. It is very hard for the parents, I just hope God gives them the strength to overcome a deep loss. This is a very bad day for the music industry.' ",
